# Standard Death Record FHIR Profiles

This repository contain the source definitions for a preliminary version of the Standard Death Record (SDR) Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Implementation Guide. [Click here to view the generated FHIR IG](https://nightingaleproject.github.io/fhir-death-record).

This guide builds on [FHIR profiles](https://github.com/BioMIBLab/fhir-death) developed as part of a collaboration between Georgia Tech and CDC.

The guide uses tooling and builds on content developed by the [Standard Health Record Collaborative](http://standardhealthrecord.org).

## Building the FHIR IG

Install the [`shr-cli`](https://github.com/standardhealth/shr-cli) tool. The current version of the guide should be built with [`shr-cli` version 5.9.0](https://github.com/standardhealth/shr-cli/releases/tag/v5.9.0) or later.

Set the `SHR_CLI_HOME` environment variable

    export SHR_CLI_HOME=/path/to/shr-cli

Configure Java proxies (if needed)

    export JAVA_OPTS="-Dhttp.proxyHost=my.proxy.org -Dhttp.proxyPort=80 -Dhttps.proxyHost=my.proxy.org -Dhttps.proxyPort=80 -DsocksProxyHost=my.proxy.org -DsocksProxyPort=80"

Compile the CIMPL definitions

    cd /path/to/fhir-death-record
    make fhir

Build the FHIR IG

    make ig
    
You can perform both final steps (compiling the CIMPL definitions and building the FHIR IG) with

    make
